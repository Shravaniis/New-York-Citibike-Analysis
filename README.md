# New York CitiBike

Citi Bike, launched in 2013, is New York City's official bike-share program, offering residents and visitors a seamless, eco-friendly transportation alternative. With over 1,700 stations and 27,000 bikes spread across Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, the Bronx, Jersey City, and Hoboken, Citi Bike has become an integral part of the urban transit landscape. Riders enjoy the freedom to unlock a bike at one station and return it to any other, making it perfect for commuting, leisure, and running errands. This vibrant program not only enhances accessibility but also encourages exploration of the city's iconic neighborhoods, parks, and attractions, embodying a fun and affordable way to experience the heart of New York City.

## Objective

To conduct a comprehensive analysis of Citi Bikeâ€™s dataset, uncovering significant trends and insights related to station locations and customer demographics. This exploration aims to reveal user behavior patterns and preferences that drive station demand. By leveraging these insights, actionable recommendations will be provided to enhance service efficiency, optimize station placements according to peak usage trends, and tailor offerings to meet the diverse needs of customer segments. Ultimately, the goal is to foster a more responsive and user-centered bike-sharing experience in New York City.

## Data Set

I've taken the Data Set from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ryanmcummings/citi-bike-data). The data set contains information about NYCitiBike's stations location as well as trip durations, cutomer gender and age and more.
